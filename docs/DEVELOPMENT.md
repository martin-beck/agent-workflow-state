# Development policy

The product is `martin-beck/agent-workflow`; this repository is its Git-backed
coordination state. Read the vendored coordinator guide and complete snapshot
before every task.

Workers claim one `open` task, use its named product branch/worktree, and run
all product, Git, review, and publication commands through `tools/handoffctl
run`. Record concise results immediately, release the task truthfully, then
reconcile and run `tools/handoffctl doctor --live` when live configuration is
available.

The state repository must retain the exact coordinator vendor manifest and
never contain credentials, prompts, raw logs, private paths, hostnames, or
machine-specific configuration. AWQ policy files belong to the product
repository and must pin an immutable released AWQ commit while retaining all
native product gates.

Child projects keep their own coordination state; do not file child ARs here.
